#How would you calculate a good tip for a 55 dollar meal?

#First, define a variable for the total meal price.
#Set the total meal price at 55
meal_price = 55

#Next, calculate the percentage tip for the meal.
#Set the tip percentage at 20%
good_tip = 0.2

#Finally, use Ruby math to calculate the tip for the meal.
puts "A good tip for a $#{meal_price} meal is $#{meal_price * good_tip}."
